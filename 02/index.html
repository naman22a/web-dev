        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a
            combination of Hypertext, and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup
            is used to define the text document within tags to structure the web pages. This language is used to
            annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses
            tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand the
            workings of HTML and explain it with examples.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
            It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors,
            fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the
            presentation of HTML elements.
            HTML uses tags and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors. CSS is
            easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language widely used in web
            development. It plays a crucial role in both front-end and back-end development, enabling dynamic and
            interactive user experiences. Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is interpreted through web browsers,
            making it highly accessible and versatile. It is a loosely typed (or weakly typed) language, meaning
            variable types are determined at runtime.

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum
            in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code
            readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a
            programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major
            Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

        <h2>C</h2>
        <p>
            C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language used in the development of computer
            software and applications, system programming, games, and more.
            C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972.
            It is a powerful and flexible language which was first developed for the programming of the UNIX operating
            System.
            C is one of the most widely used programming languages.
            C programming language is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is the best choice to start with
            programming as it gives you a foundational understanding of programming.
